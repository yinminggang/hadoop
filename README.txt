IntelÂ® QuickAssist Technology(QAT) provides hardware acceleration to assist with the performance demands of securing and routing Internet traffic and other workloads such as compression and wireless 3G/4G LTE algorithm offload, thereby reserving processor cycles for application and control processing. The aim of this project is to maximize Hadoop encryption/decryption throughput using Intel QuickAssist Technology.
